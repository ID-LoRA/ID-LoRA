## 🔧 Requirements

- **LTX-2 Model Checkpoint** - Local `.safetensors` file
- **Gemma Text Encoder** - Local Gemma model directory (required for LTX-2)
- **Linux with CUDA** - CUDA 13+ recommended for optimal performance
- **Nvidia GPU with 80GB+ VRAM** - Recommended for the standard config. For GPUs with 32GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 5090),
  use the [low VRAM config](configs/ltx2_av_lora_low_vram.yaml) which enables INT8 quantization and other
  memory optimizations
